# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

Welcome to my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project repository! This repository showcases the practical lab projects I completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course. This final capstone project, spanning six weeks, represents the culmination of my learning and skills acquired throughout the specialization.


## About the Course

The IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate is an intensive program designed to provide comprehensive training in data analysis, including data visualization, Python programming, SQL, and applied data science. This specialization has equipped me with the skills needed to tackle real-world data challenges and derive meaningful insights.


## About Projects

This repository features a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to: 

 * **Analyze complex datasets**: Apply statistical methods to interpret and draw insights from data.
 * **Visualize data effectively:** Create compelling visual representations using various data visualization tools.
 * **Program with Python:** Utilize data manipulation and analysis techniques with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
 * **Query databases with SQL:** Extract and manipulate data stored in relational databases using SQL.


## Dashboards

Throughout the capstone project, I created several interactive dashboards to visualize data insights. Here are some highlights:

### Current Technology Usage Dashboard
This dashboard visualizes the current trends in programming languages, databases, and integrated development environments (IDEs), based on survey data and job postings. It helps identify which technologies are in demand today.
